# Pipeline

In the first phase of work I used *Transkribus* (Â© ReadCoop) for the semantic annotation of layout and of the text. Then, I exported the TEI output of my work from *Transkribus* platform and I transform this output in a regular TEI XML (according to the most updated guidelines) using XSLT sheets.
