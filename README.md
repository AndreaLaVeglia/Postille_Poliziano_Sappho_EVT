# The Digital Edition of Marginal Notes of Poliziano to the Epistle of Sappho to Phaon

This is the first prototype of the digital scholarly edition (DSE) of the first part of marginal notes of Poliziano to Ovid, that we can read in the Bodl. Auct. P 2.2.
This prototype was developed as a final dissertation for the Master Degree of Andrea La Veglia at the University of Naples "Federico II" under the supervision of Prof. Giovan Battista D'Alessio and Prof. Gennaro Ferrante.
